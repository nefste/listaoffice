Welcome to the ListAnalytics GitHub repository! 
This project is designed to support sustainable practices in furniture management through a Streamlit-based application that helps users manage the lifecycle of furniture by providing tools for upcycling, selling, and donating old or no longer needed furniture.

## About ListAnalytics
